This is a project skeleton for the homework from the Haskell class being taught
as part of PDXFUNC. Instructions:
- Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/enolan/pdxfunc-cis194.git`.
  On Windows, I think [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is the
  easiest option. On Mac OS, ask someone else. Maybe homebrew?
- [Get Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- Run in this directory: `stack test`. You should get 12/22 failures.
- Edit the file `src/Week1.hs` and fill in the sections that say "YOUR CODE GOES
  HERE".
  --file-watch` will re-run the tests every time you save.
